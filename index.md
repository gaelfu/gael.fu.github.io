* Lab 4
  Lab 4, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs where I converted the number of milliliters the user would input into teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. This is one of my favorite labs since I learned how to implement functions from a different file and write out those functions. I wrote conversion equations in the functions and then printed out the results to the user listing all of the different measurements.

* Lab 5
  Lab 5, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it was my first time working with strings and changed my mindset regarding writing functions. In part 1, I used and wrote a flexible function that asks a query to the user. This function was used to ask multiple questions to the user without having to repeat the same code repeatedly, saving tons of time. I learned how to work more efficiently through using functions.

* Lab 8
  Lab 8, part 2 was also a very important lab to me since I learned how to work with vectors. In part 2 I calculated the average of the numbers the user would input as a command line argument. I stored the arguments into a vector and ran a for loop to add all of them and then divided the sum by the number of arguments minus 1 to account for the calling of the file/code to find the average.
